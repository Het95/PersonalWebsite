                    <h2>Abstract</h2>
                    <p>In recent times, various firms/companies provide services to their customers on credit. These
                        firms receive the payments, against the services and/or purchases provided to the customers but
                        not paid for, termed as Account Receivables. With an aim to plan the finance in addition to
                        decide strategies for their business, the executives of these firms desire to predict the
                        Account Receivables of their companies for a specific time span. For the said purpose, in this
                        paper, we present three different methods. These methods utilize machine learning prediction
                        modelsâ€”logistic regression, random forest classifier, and an ensemble of K-Means clustering and
                        random forest classifier discussed in the literature. However, with an aim to find the optimal
                        solution in terms of prediction accuracy, we put forward the theoretical and the experimental
                        analysis of these methods. Experimental results affirm that an ensemble of K-Means clustering
                        and random forest classifier outperforms among three methods.</p>
